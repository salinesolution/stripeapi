to run this code in your local machine:
python --version

That command will indicate if you have Python version 3.x.x or Python 2.x.x. Navigate in your terminal to the folder where you have created and if you have Python version 3.x.x type:
python -m http.server 8000

If you have Python version 2.x.x type:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

In either case, a message should appear in your terminal indicating that you've started an HTTP server on your machine. In your browser's url bar type localhost:8000 and hit enter. Your index.html page should appear.

To get out of server, type ctrl+c in your terminal.
